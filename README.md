# C2C SDE Python Environment

This project provides a Python development environment pre-configured for use with [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces). Students can create Codespaces from this repository whenever they need to code in Python for this course

## Getting Started

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a branch for yourself-and stay on it throughout the course**
   - Click the "branch" button in the top-left corner of the GitHub repo to create a branch names after you
   - At the start of each class, pull the latest `main` into your branch (example below)
   - Work in the new lesson folder (e.g. lessons/lesson-2/), commit your changes there, and push to your branch.
```bash
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
```

2. **Create a Codespace**
   - Click the green "Code" button.
   - Select the "Codespaces" tab in the popup.
   - Click the `+` button to create a new Codespace.
   - For more information, see [Opening a Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/opening-an-existing-codespace).

3. **Run the Starter Program**
   - Open a terminal in the Codespace and run the following command:

     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

   - Alternatively, open the `main.py` file in the editor and click the play button at the top-right corner.
