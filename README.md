# C2C SDE Python Environment

This project provides a Python development environment pre-configured for use with [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces). Students can create Codespaces from this repository whenever they need to code in Python for this course

## Getting Started

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a branch for yourself-and stay on it throughout the course**
   - Click the "main" button in the top-left corner of the GitHub repo to toggle branches.

2. **Create a Codespace**
   - Click the green "Code" button.
   - Select the "Create codespace on (your-branch-name) "
   - Give it a minute to load your coding environment.

3. **Pull the latest `main` changes**
   - Once your codespaces is ready, use the terminal to pull the latest `main` into your branch (steps are in each lessons' `README` file.) 
   - Work in the new lesson folder (e.g. lessons/lesson-2/), commit your changes to main.py, and push to your branch to save your work.

5. **Run the Starter Program**
   - Open a terminal in the Codespace and run the following command:

     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

   - Alternatively, open the `main.py` file in the editor and click the play button at the top-right corner.

## Key Features
